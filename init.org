* .emacs configuration
If you  are reading this, I finally got around to writing my .emacs config using Org mode. Why? Because it makes is easy to document the whys of my config. I also think it will make it fun to re-read my comments and text after some time :P

The configuration will change with time, based upon programming languages used and so on. Some languages I just se try (see below) for, because I use them so rarely :P 


** TODOs before merging to master (to remind myself)
*** DONE UPGRADE EMACS ON THE COMPUTERS YOU WILL USE THIS ON!! Preferably 27.1 
*** TODO Get all my old config that is worth keeping into this doc
*** DONE Fix the shitty line numbers I have kept for far too long (display-line-numbers-mode?)
*** TODO See if there is any bloat in EXWM config and if it can be minified
*** TODO EXWM - Look into ways of making programs less troublesome to use with their own hotkeys. Is there a whitelist/blacklist or something? 
*** use-package
**** DONE Try use-package and see if you like it better
**** DONE Transition the existing package config worth keeping over to use-package
*** DONE Transition from Eclim to Lsp alternative
Eclim has worked great, but it is a bit clunky.. And sadly do not work great with newer Java versions. Also try the Kotlin language server again. Seems like the genius of a maintainer has solved it!

Seems like lsp-java even has static imports... :O Really cool!
*** Some sort of automation pipeline? :P For fun :P Testing that it is buildable? To avoid stuff in master that does not build? Maybe some sort of tagging to make it easier to know which commit has the last successful code run? (have a simple versioning scheme like year.x? 2021.1, 2021.2 etc.?)
*** Packages that I should add that I've tried (using try) for way too long
**** DONE restclient
*** Packages to test out
**** DONE dap-mode for debugging. Try to see if you can learn it, and if it can be useful in the future
**** TODO treemacs
**** TODO which-key
**** TODO define-word
**** Is there a key promoter like thing? One of the few things in IntelliJ I think is really cool :P
**** editorconfig

*** Programming-, scripting-, markup-languages and so on
Some languages work great out of the box, some require a little tweaking. 


**** C
C does not really need much auto completion, but it can be great to have it for projects that use a lot of external libraries (like libogc for Nintendo GameCube development, where you have a SDK for the console).

*Prerequisites:* clang installed, configured =company-c-headers-path-user= (for C header completion) and =company-clang-arguments= (for company-clang, which is built-into company-mode). Both can be set to the same list of include paths (with the clang one starting with "-I"). .dir-locals.el works fine for this purpose :) (standard paths are default for company-clang if you do not cross-compile or something similar).

*** Other operations and tooling?
A section like this to write about restclient and other similar topics? 

Undo-tree. I LOOOOVE undo-tree <3 Instead of having a linear line of operations we can undo and redo, I have a tree I can navigate :D
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree

  TODO: should I have a screenshot of the tree
  TODO: does this belong in a more central place? It is awesome package that helps me everyday...


 Emacs works great as a REST client (also used it for other HTTP requests, e.g, SOAP), mostly because of the amazing restclient(-mode):
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package restclient)
#+END_SRC
TODO: should this be another place? Or does it belong in the editor category? Own category? Tooling and other? 

*** Writing (books/org-mode etc.)
Emacs can also be a great editor for editing books, note sand other things. Some people might miss formatting like headers while editing, but that is what org mode is for :) Blogging with org mode is also a fantastic experience! (also, this configuration is written with org-mode!!!)

org mode (maybe move the intro from above?)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org
    :init
    (setq org-startup-with-inline-images t
        org-todo-keyword-faces '(("DONE" . "GREEN"))
        org-hide-emphasis-markers t)

    :hook
    ;; make org mode easier to read with indentation
    (org-mode . org-indent-mode))


  ;; add bullets to prettify the org mode stars
  (use-package org-bullets
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))

TODO: olivetti to improve readability
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package olivetti
    :init

    :hook org-mode)
#+END_SRC



I sometimes also use LaTeX (or export org to latex and take it from there). Then auctex is  useful.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Sets the zoom level of latex fragments (in Org Mode)
  (defun update-org-latex-fragments ()  
	(with-current-buffer (current-buffer)
	  (when (derived-mode-p 'LaTeX-mode 'TeX-mode 'latex-mode 'tex-mode)
		(set-default 'preview-scale-function text-scale-mode-amount)
		(preview-buffer))))
  (add-hook 'text-scale-mode-hook 'update-org-latex-fragments)


  ;; Issue with package name and providing it.
  ;; use-package auctex gives an error with "failed to provide feature auctex" because of older naming in files.
