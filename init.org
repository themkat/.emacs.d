* .emacs configuration
If you  are reading this, I finally got around to writing my .emacs config using Org mode. Why? Because it makes is easy to document the whys of my config. I also think it will make it fun to re-read my comments and text after some time :P

The configuration will change with time, based upon programming languages used and so on. For some languages I just use try to use them in the current session (see below), because I use them so rarely :P 


When starting my configuration, it will look like the following (see below for configuration of dashboard, modeline etc. :) ):

** Basic setup
Before we begin, we have to do some basic setup. For the rest of the config, I will use =use-package= to install packages. I want newer packages, and packages not available in the gnu repos, so adding MELPA and the org repo (to get newest org mode). Then we install =use-package= and set te always ensure variable to make sure it always tries to download the packages we want. 


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;; sets lexical bindings so we get real closres with let etc. like in Scheme

  ;; TODO: do we need both melpa and melpa-stable. Isn't melpa enough? 
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)  ;; for newest version of org mode
  (package-initialize)

  ;; only refresh package contents if we havent downloaded it yet.
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  ;; always download packages when we don't have them locally
  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure 't)
#+END_SRC


** Keep packages up-to-date
I'm a bit lazy when it comes to updating packages manually, so automating this is a welcome addition :)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package auto-package-update
    :custom
    (auto-package-update-interval 31)
    (auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t)

    (auto-package-update-show-preview t)
  
    :config
    (auto-package-update-maybe))
#+END_SRC


** EXWM - Emacs Window manager
On my GNU/Linux machines I have used EXWM as a window manager for quite a while. It makes navigating windows easier, and makes it possible to do everything in Emacs <3 To set it up, I set up a custom X-session with a .xinitrc file for my user:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle "no"
  # various settings like sound applets depending on distro and tooling
  # examples include nm-applet, xfsettingsd & etc. to be able to piggyback on some xcfe tooling etc.

  # define this environment variable to enable tangling and running of exwm config
  export USE_EXWM="yes"
  exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs
#+END_SRC

Then on launch it will run the following setup for using EXWM:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle (if (getenv "USE_EXWM") "yes" "no")
  (defun themkat/setup-exwm ()

                            (message (concat "Changed keyboard layout to: " currLayout)))))

#+END_SRC

Desktop environment can also be very useful when Emacs blocks the function keys (volume etc.). I have this issue with EXWM, and desktop-environment fixes it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package desktop-environment
    :requires exwm
    :init
    (desktop-environment-mode))
#+END_SRC


** Behaviorial settings
These settings control how Emacs behaves in general (i.e, for all modes); what UI elements to show, theming, what meta-key to use on Mac OS X, Helm to navigatge etc. :) 


*** general
I use some general settings to make Emacs feel better. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; TODO: do these, the clipboard settings belong in editor settings instead?

  ;; Get PATH from session instead of whatever idiotic things are done before
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :init
    (when (memq window-system '(mac ns x))
      (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)))


  ;; set default coding of buffers
  (setq default-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)

  ;; switched from tabs to spaces for indentation
  ;; also set the indentation level to 4.
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
  (setq-default tab-width 4)


  ;; Don't autosave. 
  (setq auto-save-default nil)


  ;; GUI related settings
  (if (display-graphic-p)
      (progn
        ;; Removed annoying UI elements
        (menu-bar-mode -1)
        (tool-bar-mode -1)
        (scroll-bar-mode -1)
	  
        ;; shows battery status (useful when using EXWM)
        (display-battery-mode 1)))

  ;; disable the C-z sleep/suspend key
  ;; rarely use emacs in terminal mode anymore and that is the only place it can be useful
  ;; see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28202546/hitting-ctrl-z-in-emacs-freezes-everything
  ;;  for a way to have both if I ever want that again.
  (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))

  ;; disable the C-x C-b key, because I use helm (C-x b) instead
  (global-unset-key (kbd "C-x C-b"))


  (setq display-time-default-load-average nil)
  (setq display-time-day-and-date t display-time-24hr-format t)
  (display-time-mode t)


  ;; make copy and paste use the same clipboard as emacs.
  (setq select-enable-primary t
        select-enable-clipboard t)


  ;; sets monday to be the first day of the week in calendar
  (setq calendar-week-start-day 1)

  ;; save emacs backups in a different directory

  (setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacsbackups")))


  ;; Enable show-paren-mode (to visualize paranthesis) and make it possible to delete things we have marked

This one only applies to Mac, but makes my life easier. The different brackets became almost impossible to use without this :P Controlling which key is the actual meta key. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta) 
  (setq mac-option-modifier nil)
#+END_SRC


*** Key help
Sometimes I forget a hotkey-sequence I don't use that often, or a better case just remember the beginning of a longer sequence. Then which-key comes in handy! which-key shows possible continuations of a key-sequence. If you type C-x with your keyboard, it will suggest many continuations like C-+, C--, h etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :custom
    (which-key-idle-delay 5)
    :config
    (which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC


*** helm
I use helm because i prefer it to ido or alternatives. It is simple to use, has a great UI, and to me it makes Emacs even more powerful as both a text editor and window manager (to switch windows). It will install after projectile (which makes project handling a breeze), which is found with the git and project handling setup [[*git and project handling]]. Here I simply activate it, make the search less rigid (not just beginning of strings, but anywhere in them), remove certain buffers from the buffer list and activate some key bindings globally to do various operations. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :after (projectile helm-projectile)

    :init
    (helm-mode 1)
    (projectile-mode +1)
    (helm-projectile-on)
    (helm-adaptive-mode 1)
    ;; hide uninteresting buffers from buffer list
    (add-to-list 'helm-boring-buffer-regexp-list (rx "magit-"))
    (add-to-list 'helm-boring-buffer-regexp-list (rx "*helm"))

    :custom
    (helm-M-x-fuzzy-match t)
    (projectile-completion-system 'helm)
    (helm-split-window-in-side-p t)
  
    :bind
    (("M-x" . helm-M-x)
     ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files)
     ;; get the awesome buffer list instead of the standard stuff
     ("C-x b" . helm-mini)))
#+END_SRC


*** Installing system packages (apt, homebrew etc.)
*TODO: Check if this should be somewhere else in the config*
Having searches for system packages and installations directly in Emacs is pretty neat! 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-system-packages
    :after helm)
#+END_SRC


*** dashboard
Emacs is always open at my machine, so I really enjoy a friendly startup screen :) dashboard provides what I want with projects (from projectiles list), recently edited files and latest news from Hackernews. To make the experience even better I also install all-the-icons to get pretty icons.
*NOTE:* At first run, you should run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= to get the fonts needed for the icons to show properly. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Getting pretty icons 
  (use-package all-the-icons)

  (use-package dashboard
    :after (all-the-icons dashboard-hackernews helm-system-packages)
    :init
    (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)

    :custom
    (dashboard-banner-logo-title "Welcome my queen! Make some kewl stuff today!")
    (dashboard-startup-banner 'logo)
    (dashboard-center-content t)

    (dashboard-set-file-icons t)
    (dashboard-items '((projects . 5)
                       (recents . 5)
                       (hackernews . 5))))


  (use-package dashboard-hackernews)
#+END_SRC

*** themes and ui
To make Emacs better looking, I use the leuven-theme. This theme improves org-mode readability and makes Emacs blue and pretty in general :) I used to use doom-themes, moe-themes and so on with a simple theme switcher function, but I mostly just use leuven so I decided to remove them. The modeline is made prettier and more modern with doom modeline to get a beautiful powerline :) 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package leuven-theme
    :init
    (load-theme 'leuven t))

  (use-package doom-modeline
    :init
    (doom-modeline-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** try
Sometimes I like to try packages without having them as a permanent part of my Emacs setup. try does exactly that, where the packages are gone after Emacs is closed. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package try)
#+END_SRC


** Editing  settings

*** General editing
Line numbers
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC


Yasnippet makes boiler plate and other code snippets much faster to write with snippets that activates with small keywords. Just type the keyword and TAB, and yasnippet will fill in the snippet :) (you may have to fill in some names like class name or parameter names after TAB off course...).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet
    :config

#+END_SRC



Sometimes we want to edit multiple places in the file at the same time. Most of the time this is just adding the same characters multiple places in the file in places with the same pattern, other times it is inserting a sequence of numbers.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      :bind
      ("C->" . mc/mark-next-like-this))
#+END_SRC


Paredit makes paranthesis handling a breeze in Lisp-languages :) Only setting I really need is to make it possible to select something and delete the selection (including the paranthesis).
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package paredit
      :config 
      ;; making paredit work with delete-selection-mode
      ;; found on the excellent place called what the emacs d.
      (put 'paredit-forward-delete 'delete-selection 'supersede)

      (put 'paredit-open-square 'delete-selection t)
      (put 'paredit-doublequote 'delete-selection t)
      (put 'paredit-newline 'delete-selection t)

Certain strings should in my view be translated to unicode symbols, and so far I just set some defaults for all modes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; should I defaults? or maybe one for c-like languages, one for lisp etc.?
  (setq-default prettify-symbols-alist '(("lambda" . 955)

                                         ("!=" . 8800)))
  (global-prettify-symbols-mode)
#+END_SRC


Undo-tree. I LOOOOVE undo-tree <3 Instead of having a linear line of operations we can undo and redo, I have a tree I can navigate :D
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    :custom
    (undo-tree-history-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/undo"))))
#+END_SRC

Emojis in comments, org mode text and other places are really fun and makes the text feel more alive (instead of showing codes for emojis where applicable). (sometimes I turn it off because it ends up emojifying too much, but that is easy with =M-x emojify-mode=).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package emojify
    :init
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-emojify-mode))
#+END_SRC


*** Spell checking
Acivate spell checking for some relevant modes, set some preferred languages and makes the correction prettier with helm. 
	
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; FlySpell (spell checking)
  (dolist (flyspellmodes '(text-mode-hook
						   org-mode-hook
						   latex-mode-hook))

	(define-key flyspell-mode-map (kbd "C-.") nil)
	(define-key flyspell-mode-map (kbd "C-,") #'helm-flyspell-correct))
#+END_SRC

*** Completion general
company (COMPLete ANY) provides base functionality for completions (ui elements, searching for candidates etc). For many modes, company is sufficient, but for some languages it can be great to use with something like lsp-mode to provide more advanced completion (like for Java and Kotlin). 


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :init
    (global-company-mode)

    :custom
    ;; set the completion to begin at once
    (company-idle-delay 0)
    (company-echo-delay 0)
    (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
  
    :bind
    ;; trigger company to see a list of choices even when nothing is typed. maybe it quit because we clicked something. or maybe we dont know what to type yet :P
    ;; CTRL-ENTER. Because C-RET does not work. 
    ([(control return)] . company-complete))


  ;; a nicer way to show company completions with icons and doc popup where available (lsp etc.)
  ;; Also doesn't clutter up the screen with super-big multiline truncated lines
  (use-package company-box

#+END_SRC


*** IDE functionality - general
*LSP = Language Server Protocol*
lsp-mode uses LSP servers to provides IDE functionality like code completion (intellisense like using company-capf), navigation (jump to symbol), refactoring functionality and so on. lsp-ui is used to get prettier boxes and more info visible in an easy way (like javadoc). Currently dap-mode is added because I play a bit with it, and my first impressions are great so far (for the few times I use a debugger, I know I'm weird for not needing it much at all). 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-mode
    :bind

Some modes uses flycheck to provide syntax correctness checks (e.g, red lines below errors).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck

    (flycheck-indication-mode nil)
    (flycheck-highlighting-mode 'lines))

*** Programming-, scripting-, markup-languages and so on
Some languages work great out of the box, some require a little tweaking. 


**** C
C does not really need much auto completion, but it can be great to have it for projects that use some external libraries (like libogc for Nintendo GameCube development, where you have a SDK for the console). I used to just use company-c-headers and company-clang for this, but realized that some extra popups with documentation comments, error checking, completion etc. was most welcome! CCLS is a language server that provides that for C, C++, CUDA C etc.

*Prerequisites:* To get all include paths and settings for a project correct, one should create a =compile_commands.json= file that CCLS will read. I use CompileDB to generate this file, as it seems to generate a useful file even for projects where tools like Bear have problems. For CMake projects (ugh), one simply adds =-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES= to the cmake command.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ccls
    :after (lsp-mode)
    :hook
    (c-mode . (lambda ()
                (require 'ccls)
                (lsp))))
#+END_SRC

**** Assembly (various flavors)
6502 Assembly (especially for Commodore 64):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mos-mode)
#+END_SRC
(my own package lol)

**** Rust
Recently started experimenting more with Rust. rustic seems to be the best package for working with it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rustic
    :after (yasnippet)

    :custom
    (rustic-format-trigger 'on-save)
    (rustic-format-on-save-method 'rustic-format-buffer)

    :hook
    (rustic-mode . yas-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC


**** Java
lsp-java :drool: 

Java IDE-like functionality in Emacs. When we run this mode for the first time, the lsp server will be downloaded automatically. Works like a charm!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-java
    :hook
    (java-mode . lsp)

    :bind
    (:map java-mode-map 
          ("M-RET" . lsp-java-organize-imports)))


  ;; Java snippets for yasnippet. Found them very useful so far
  (use-package java-snippets
    :after yasnippet
    :hook
    (java-mode . yas-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC


**** Kotlin
lsp-mode works out of the box with Kotlin mode as long as [[https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-language-server][kotlin-language-server]] is in the path :) So I only install Kotlin-mode :)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun themkat/kotlin-register-debug-templates ()
    ;; various debug templates for Kotlin will be put here
    (dap-register-debug-template "Kotlin tests with launcher"
                               (list :type "kotlin"
                                     :request "launch"
                                     :mainClass "org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --scan-class-path"
                                     :enableJsonLogging nil
                                     :noDebug nil)))

  (use-package kotlin-mode
    :after (lsp-mode dap-mode yasnippet)
    :config
    (require 'dap-kotlin)
    ;; should probably have been in dap-kotlin instead of lsp-kotlin
    (setq lsp-kotlin-debug-adapter-path (or (executable-find "kotlin-debug-adapter") ""))
    (themkat/kotlin-register-debug-templates)
    :hook
    (kotlin-mode . lsp)
    (kotlin-mode . yas-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC

**** TypeScript
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Function to activate tide by need
  (defun themkat/activate-tide ()
    (interactive)
    (tide-setup)
    (flycheck-mode 1)
    (setq flycheck-check-syntax-automatically '(save mode-enabled))
    (eldoc-mode 1)
    (tide-hl-identifier-mode 1))

  (use-package tide
    :init
    (add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook #'themkat/activate-tide))
#+END_SRC

**** Web development (HTML, CSS, basic JS etc.)
Makes it more comfortable to edit mixed files (javascript + html in same document, jsx etc.). 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun themkat/complete-web-mode ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((current-scope (web-mode-language-at-pos (point))))
      (cond ((string-equal "javascript" current-scope)
             (company-tide 'interactive))
            ((string-equal "css" current-scope)
             (company-css 'interactive))
            (t
             (company-dabbrev-code 'interactive)))))

  (defun themkat/eldoc-web-mode ()
    (let ((current-scope (web-mode-language-at-pos (point))))
      (cond ((string-equal "javascript" current-scope)
             (tide-eldoc-function))
            ((string-equal "css" current-scope)
             (css-eldoc-function))
            (t
             nil))))

  (defun themkat/setup-web-mode-mixed ()
    (web-mode)
    (themkat/activate-tide)
    (setq-local eldoc-documentation-function #'themkat/eldoc-web-mode))

  (use-package web-mode
    :after (tide css-eldoc)
    :custom
    (web-mode-enable-current-element-highlight t)

    :init
    (require 'web-mode)

    :bind
    (:map web-mode-map ([(control return)] . themkat/complete-web-mode))

    :mode
    (("\\.html?$" . themkat/setup-web-mode-mixed)
     ("\\.jsx?$" . web-mode)))
#+END_SRC

Having eldoc for CSS and SASS helps a lot for remembering input parameters without looking stuff up:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package css-eldoc
    :hook
    (css-mode . turn-on-css-eldoc)
    (scss-mode . turn-on-css-eldoc))
#+END_SRC

 Emacs works great as a REST client (also used it for other HTTP requests, e.g, SOAP), mostly because of the amazing restclient(-mode):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package restclient)
#+END_SRC



**** Python
I sometimes write Python code for various things, sometimes as a calculator :P (SymPy, NumPy and MatplotLib <3 ). I choose to start lsp manually due to sometimes not needing a language server for minor edits (which is what I mostly do with Python).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-pyright
    :after lsp-mode
    :init
    (require 'lsp-pyright))
#+END_SRC


**** Scheme
Use geiser to make Scheme great to work with. Not really used much anymore, but still fun to write some small procdures in Scheme once in a while :) 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package geiser
    :init
    (setq geiser-active-implementations '(racket)))
#+END_SRC

**** Dockerfiles
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dockerfile-mode
    :init
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Dockerfile" . dockerfile-mode)))
#+END_SRC


**** Gherkin-like feature files
Used in Cucumber, Karate and more :) Useful to have for the situations where you edit a file like that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package feature-mode)
#+END_SRC

**** Markdown
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode)
#+END_SRC


**** YAML
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yaml-mode)
#+END_SRC

**** XML
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq nxml-child-indent 4)
  (setq nxml-attribute-indent 4)
#+END_SRC

*** git and project handling
This is almost a reason to use Emacs by itself! Magit is the best way to experience git in my view. Simple and quick to use, together with its connection with git-gutter-fringe makes it super awesome!
TODO: screenshots?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :commands magit-status
    :bind
    ("C-x g" . magit-status))

  ;; show todos in magit status buffer
  (use-package magit-todos
    :after (magit)
    :hook
    (magit-status-mode . magit-todos-mode)
    :bind
    ("C-x t" . helm-magit-todos))

  (use-package git-gutter
    :ensure git-gutter-fringe
    :after magit
    :init
    (global-git-gutter-mode 1)
    (setq-default left-fringe-width 20)

    :hook
    (magit-post-refresh . git-gutter:update-all-windows))


  ;; TODO: maybe move it? Now it is very far down from where it is originally referenced (in helm)
  (use-package projectile)
  (use-package helm-projectile)
#+END_SRC

How to this look? In this Emacs repo with my local untracked file (should probably make a gitignore), todos and changes, it looks about like this in the magit status buffer:

[[./magit.png]]



*** Writing (books/org-mode etc.)
Emacs can also be a great editor for editing books, note sand other things. Some people might miss formatting like headers while editing, but that is what org mode is for :) Blogging with org mode is also a fantastic experience! (also, this configuration is written with org-mode!!!)

org mode (maybe move the intro from above?)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org
    :custom
    (org-startup-with-inline-images t)
    (org-startup-folded t)
    (org-todo-keyword-faces '(("DONE" . "GREEN")))
    (org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
    (org-image-actual-width nil)
    (org-support-shift-select t)

    :hook
    ;; make org mode easier to read with indentation
    (org-mode . org-indent-mode))


  ;; add bullets to prettify the org mode stars
  (use-package org-bullets
    :after org
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))


  ;; add a table of contents to sections tagged with TOC on save (updates it by need)
  (use-package toc-org
    :after org
    :hook
    (org-mode . toc-org-mode))
#+END_SRC


Olivetti to improve readability. Olivetti centers the entire buffer like a sheet of paper and truncates the content. This helps my eyes when writing things that are more natural flowing text (articles, books, other org mode stuff). 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle (if (display-graphic-p) "yes" "no")
  (use-package olivetti
    :if window-system
    :after org
    :custom
    (olivetti-minimum-body-width 100)
    (olivetti-body-width 0.8)
    :hook
    (org-mode . olivetti-mode))
#+END_SRC


Currently experimenting with presentations from Emacs as well:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; hiding the mode line can be useful for presentations
  (use-package hide-mode-line)

  (defun org-tree-slide--start-handler ()
    (hide-mode-line-mode 1)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-meta-line nil
                        :foreground (face-attribute 'default :background)
                        :background (face-attribute 'default :background)))

  (defun org-tree-slide--stop-handler ()
    (hide-mode-line-mode nil)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-meta-line nil
                        :foreground nil
                        :background nil))

  (use-package org-tree-slide
    :config
    (add-hook 'org-tree-slide-play-hook  #'org-tree-slide--start-handler)
    (add-hook 'org-tree-slide-stop-hook  #'org-tree-slide--stop-handler))
#+END_SRC



I sometimes also use LaTeX (or export org to latex and take it from there). Then auctex is  useful.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle (if (display-graphic-p) "yes" "no")
    ;; Sets the zoom level of latex fragments (in Org Mode)
    (defun update-org-latex-fragments ()  
      (with-current-buffer (current-buffer)
        (when (derived-mode-p 'LaTeX-mode 'TeX-mode 'latex-mode 'tex-mode)
          (set-default 'preview-scale-function text-scale-mode-amount)
          (preview-buffer))))
    (add-hook 'text-scale-mode-hook 'update-org-latex-fragments)


    ;; Issue with package name and providing it.
    ;; use-package auctex gives an error with "failed to provide feature auctex" because of older naming in files.
    ;; https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/41321/when-to-specify-a-package-name-in-use-packages-ensure-tag/41324#41324
    ;; (use-package tex
    ;;   :ensure auctex
    ;;   :defer t
    ;;   :config
    ;;   ;; Preview of LaTeX formulae, tables, tikz drawings etc. 
    ;;   (setq TeX-auto-save t)
    ;;   (setq TeX-parse-self t)

    ;;   ;; make C-. the button for preview in latex mode
    ;;   (define-key LaTeX-mode-map (kbd "C-.") 'preview-buffer)
    ;;   ;; let us use minted with the preview (minted fragments is not previewed :( )
    ;;   (setcdr (assoc "LaTeX" TeX-command-list)
    ;; 		  '("%`%l%(mode) -shell-escape%' %t"
    ;; 			TeX-run-TeX nil (latex-mode doctex-mode) :help "Run LaTeX")))
