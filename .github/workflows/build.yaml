name: Run setup through Emacs and see if it gives errors

# Why have a pipeline?
# - To see that quick pushes don't break anything
# - (Older) packages might be deleted from Melpa (happened with Pretty-Lambdada), and then I can fix it before experiencing it on a new machine (which might happen much later when I'm too dependent on that package)
# - See that the changes will work on any machine and don't depend on local circumstances
