* .emacs configuration
If you  are reading this, I finally got around to writing my .emacs config using Org mode. Why? Because it makes is easy to document the whys of my config. I also think it will make it fun to re-read my comments and text after some time :P

The configuration will change with time, based upon programming languages used and so on. Some languages I just se try (see below) for, because I use them so rarely :P 


** TODOs before merging to master (to remind myself)
*** DONE UPGRADE EMACS ON THE COMPUTERS YOU WILL USE THIS ON!! Preferably 27.1 
*** TODO Get all my old config that is worth keeping into this doc
*** DONE Fix the shitty line numbers I have kept for far too long (display-line-numbers-mode?)
*** TODO See if there is any bloat in EXWM config and if it can be minified
*** TODO EXWM - Look into ways of making programs less troublesome to use with their own hotkeys. Is there a whitelist/blacklist or something? 
*** use-package
**** DONE Try use-package and see if you like it better
**** TODO Transition the existing package config worth keeping over to use-package
*** TODO Transition from Eclim to Lsp alternative
Eclim has worked great, but it is a bit clunky.. And sadly do not work great with newer Java versions. Also try the Kotlin language server again. Seems like the genius of a maintainer has solved it!

Seems like lsp-java even has static imports... :O Really cool!
*** Some sort of automation pipeline? :P For fun :P Testing that it is buildable? To avoid stuff in master that does not build? Maybe some sort of tagging to make it easier to know which commit has the last successful code run? (have a simple versioning scheme like year.x? 2021.1, 2021.2 etc.?)
*** Packages that I should add that I've tried (using try) for way too long
**** DONE restclient
*** Packages to test out
**** TODO dap-mode for debugging. Try to see if you can learn it, and if it can be useful in the future
**** TODO treemacs
**** TODO which-key
**** TODO define-word
**** Is there a key promoter like thing? One of the few things in IntelliJ I think is really cool :P
**** editorconfig

** Basic setup
TODO: maybe just quick package setup and installation of use-package (then use-package will do the rest)

TODO: include always ensure for use-package?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; TODO: do we need both melpa and melpa-stable. Isn't melpa enough? 
  (require 'package) 
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)  ;; for newest version of org mode
  (package-initialize)

  ;; only refresh package contents if we havent downloaded it yet.
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  ;; always download packages when we don't have them locally
  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure 't)
#+END_SRC



** EXWM - Emacs Window manager
keep the "useful for exwm" in this category as well. if not I would probably not use it... 
TODO: maybe just a quick intro and a load statement? no need to clutter the main config file with that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (getenv "USE_EXWM")
	  (use-package exwm
				   ;; TODO: rest of the settings. SHould i inline everything?
				   ))
#+END_SRC

TODO: should we have desktop-environment here as well? Maybe that should require exwm. That way it is never loaded if we don't use exwm on that machine. 


** Behaviorial settings
general settings that works in all modes
*** general
I use some general settings to make Emacs feel better. These are not necessarily connected to any modes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Removed annoying UI elements
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)

  (setq display-time-default-load-average nil)
  (setq display-time-day-and-date t display-time-24hr-format t)
  (display-time-mode t)
#+END_SRC

This one only applies to Mac, but makes my life easier. The different brackets became almost impossible to use without this :P Controlling which key is the actual meta key. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta) 
  (setq mac-option-modifier nil)
#+END_SRC


*** helm
intro on helm? 
I use helm because i prefer it to ido or alternatives. It is simple to use, has a great UI, and to me it makes Emacs even more powerful as both a text editor and window manager (to switch windows). 

TODO: will ensure also make sure requires are installed?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
               :after projectile
			 
               :init
               (helm-mode 1)
               (projectile-global-mode 1)
               (helm-projectile-on)
               (helm-adaptive-mode 1)
               (setq helm-M-x-fuzzy-match t
                     projectile-completion-system 'helm
                     helm-split-window-in-side-p t)
               ;; hide uninteresting buffers from buffer list
               (add-to-list 'helm-boring-buffer-regexp-list (rx "*magit"))
               (add-to-list 'helm-boring-buffer-regexp-list (rx "*helm"))
			 
               :bind
               (("M-x" . helm-M-x)
                ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files)
                ;; get the awesome buffer list instead of the standard stuff
                ("C-x b" . helm-mini)))
#+END_SRC

*** dashboard
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :config
    (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
    (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "Welcome my queen! Make some kewl stuff today!"
          dashboard-startup-banner 'logo

  (use-package dashboard-hackernews)
#+END_SRC

*** themes and ui
TODO: include the doom-themes? or should I just keep the leuven theme for now?
TODO: powerine? to modernize the look a bit? maybe try it and see if you like it?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package leuven-theme
    :init
    (load-theme 'leuven t))


  ;; TODO: have this in its own section?
  (use-package telephone-line
    :init
    (telephone-line-mode 1))
#+END_SRC


*** diminish mode (to get rid of boring stuff in mode-line)
company-mode, unto-tree Helm etc.? more?

TODO: is this needed after I add telephone line? It actually looks quite good "out of the box". 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package diminish
	;; TODO: should we have requires or something for the modes we diminish?
	:config
	(diminish 'company-mode)

#+END_SRC

*** Other
describing try and the other similar ones? 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package try)
#+END_SRC


** Editing  settings
some intro?

TODO: just have settings for each programming language? or programming in general (so web development could be one category?)

*** General editing
TODO: should company related settings be here? Or in their own heading (Completion?)?


Line numbers? (or should this be in a programming category?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'prog-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)

  ;; TODO: settings to mark the current line
  (custom-set-faces

#+END_SRC
  

  Multiple cursors.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  paredit? or should it be at a more central place?
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package paredit

      (put 'paredit-newline 'delete-selection t))
#+END_SRC


pretty symbols? seems like i just have to set an alist with unicode codes for the characters I want (and the string to do it for)
(could probably be buffer local as well. Saving a few I really miss here :smile: )
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; should I defaults? or maybe one for c-like languages, one for lisp etc.?
  (setq-default prettify-symbols-alist '(("lambda" . 955)
                                         ("->" . 8594)
                                         ("!=" . 8800)))

#+END_SRC


emojis? :P or is that better someplace else?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package emojify
    :init
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-emojify-mode))
#+END_SRC


*** IDE functionality - general
describe lsp-mode and maybe dap-mode. lsp-ui as well probably. Because I think it can be great in languages like Java

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-mode)

  ;; helper boxes and other nice functionality (like javadoc for java)
  (use-package lsp-ui)


  ;; debugger component (for the few times I need it)
  (use-package dap-mode
    :after lsp-mode
    :init
    (dap-auto-configure-mode))
#+END_SRC


flycheck? or could that be its own thing?   
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck)
#+END_SRC


*** Completion general? (or should this be general editing?) - general -- TODO: move to before IDE functionality? 
company time! just a use-package with company-mode for the most basic settings. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-mode
    :init
    (global-company-mode)

    ;; set the completion to begin at once
    (setq company-idle-delay 0
          company-echo-delay 0
          company-minimum-prefix-length 1)

    :bind
    ;; trigger company to see a list of choices even when nothing is typed. maybe it quit because we clicked something. or maybe we dont know what to type yet :P
    ;; CTRL-ENTER. Because C-RET does not work. 
    ([(control return)] . company-complete))
#+END_SRC

*** Programming-, scripting-, markup-languages and so on
Some languages work great out of the box (mostly those with little tooling needed, like Assembly and C), some require a little tweaking. 

**** Java
lsp-java :drool:
TODO: try it out a bit!! Maybe with a small spring boot app? :)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-java
    :init
    (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'lsp))


  ;; Java snippets for yasnippet. Found them very useful so far
  (use-package java-snippets
    :after yasnippet
    :init
    (add-hook 'java-mode-hook #'yas-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC


**** Kotlin

lsp-mode works out of the box with Kotlin mode as long as kotlin-language-server is in the path :) So I only install Kotlin-mode :)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package kotlin-mode
    :hook
    (java-mode . lsp))
#+END_SRC


**** Web development
lorem
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package web-mode
    :init
    (setq web-mode-enable-current-element-highlight t)

    :mode
    ;; TODO: should I rewrite to a single regex?
    (("\\.html?$" . web-mode)
     ("\\.jsx?$" . web-mode)))
#+END_SRC

**** TypeScript

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; TODO: can we use lambda in hooks? doesnt seem that way?
  (use-package tide
    :init
    (add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook '(lambda ()
                                       (tide-setup)
                                       (flycheck-mode 1)

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Dockerfile" . dockerfile-mode)))
#+END_SRC


**** Gherkin-like feature files
Used in Cucumber, Karate and more :) Useful to have for the situations where you edit a file like that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package feature-mode)
#+END_SRC

**** Markdown

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode)
#+END_SRC


**** YAML

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yaml-mode)
#+END_SRC


*** git
This is almost a reason to use Emacs by itself! Magit is the best way to experience git in my view. Simple and quick to use, together with its connection with git-gutter-fringe makes it super awesome!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :bind
    ("C-x g" . magit-status))

  (use-package git-gutter-fringe
    :after magit
    :init
    (global-git-gutter-mode 1)
    (setq-default left-fringe-width 20)

    :hook
    (magit-post-refresh-hook . #'git-gutter:update-all-windows))
#+END_SRC

*** Other operations and tooling?
A section like this to write about restclient and other similar topics? 

Undo-tree. I LOOOOVE undo-tree <3 Instead of having a linear line of operations we can undo and redo, I have a tree I can navigate :D
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :init
    (global-undo-tree-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

  TODO: should I have a screenshot of the tree
  TODO: does this belong in a more central place? It is awesome package that helps me everyday...


 Emacs works great as a REST client (also used it for other HTTP requests, e.g, SOAP), mostly because of the amazing restclient(-mode):
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package restclient)
#+END_SRC
TODO: should this be another place? Or does it belong in the editor category? Own category? Tooling and other? 

*** Writing (books/org-mode etc.)
Emacs can also be a great editor for editing books, note sand other things. Some people might miss formatting like headers while editing, but that is what org mode is for :) Blogging with org mode is also a fantastic experience! (also, this configuration is written with org-mode!!!)

org mode (maybe move the intro from above?)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org
    :init
    (setq org-startup-with-inline-images t
        org-todo-keyword-faces '(("DONE" . "GREEN"))
        org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
  
    :hook
    ;; make org mode easier to read with indentation
    (org-mode . org-indent-mode))


  ;; add bullets to prettify the org mode stars
  (use-package org-bullets
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))
#+END_SRC
